# Text Editor


![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AndreGitHub-MIT-green.svg)

The task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser and also offline. The app is a single-page application that meets all the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline as you can install in your computer. The application has been deployed to Heroku. Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
